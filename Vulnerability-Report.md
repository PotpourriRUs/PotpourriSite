## Vulnerability One

### Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

We have vulnerabilities in our script tags. Technically if organizations like Bootstrap, or Jquery, could inject malicious content into their files that could extract personal data from my Ecommerce website's Users. Which is not good, like passwords, cookies, and other goodies.

Anytime we have a <script> tag in our html, it is an open call for that org to inject unwanted scripts into our website. Because it is just a simple line a code to direct us to their file system, we would have no idea they changed/added anything. 

It wouldn't be code that would fix this, but to download their SDK and look into their files to check ourselves that nothing malicious was in it, then use our local files instead of a script tag. This would insure we know exactly what comes with the SDK and that our users are safe. An issue not so much, more of a good practice to only add script tags from reliable sources.

## Vulernability Two

### Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

We do not have CORS vulnerability problems. We have access restrictions all over our site to only allow. These are only activated because of a UseCors(); line in our startup Config. This would be identified or become vulnerable if a user could access a admin page. By manually changing the url to something like www.Site.com/Admin/Dashboard and having access. Ours however does not because the site is properly laid out with Role claims and user Access restriction.

This isn't an issue in .NET Core because of the easy restrictions we can added to our controllers to prevent users to access unwanted parts of our site.
